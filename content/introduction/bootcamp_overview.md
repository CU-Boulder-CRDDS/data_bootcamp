# Research Data Bootcamp Overview

Welcome to the Research Data Bootcamp for incoming CU Boulder graduate students. The Bootcamp is sponsored and organized by the Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship (CRDDS), which is a collaboration between CU Boulder University Libraries, and Research Computing. You can view the CRDDS website [here](https://www.colorado.edu/crdds/).

As incoming graduate students, it is likely that you will work with research data at some point during the course of your respective programs. The goal of this Bootcamp is to provide you with an overview of some of the skills, strategies, and best practices that will help you to get started in pursuing this kind of work. The Bootcamp does not presuppose any prior experience in working with research data, and all of the sessions are introductory in nature. Our purpose is not to help you master any given topic, but to provide a useful and productive starting point for further exploration and learning. As you explore further after the Bootcamp and into the semester, we hope you'll make use of CRDDS's many resources, such as opportunities for individual consultations and workshops (many of which will cover the material introduced here in greater depth). More information about these opportunities is provided on the CRDDS website. For related offerings, please also see the [website](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/lisa/) of our collaborators at the Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis (LISA).

In thinking about the various skills and tasks that are relevant to projects that involve research data, librarians and data professionals often think in terms of a heuristic called the research data lifecycle:

The lifecycle model specifies, in broad terms, the distinct yet interconnected stages of a data-intensive research project; each stage involves a variety of more specific tasks and competencies, as represented in the following [graphic](https://www.colorado.edu/crdds/what-we-do/research-lifecycle) from the CRDDS website:
