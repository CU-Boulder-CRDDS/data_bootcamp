# Research Data Bootcamp Microcredential (Digital Badge)

The goal of the Research Data Bootcamp Microcredential (i.e. the digital badge) is to provide learners with an opportunity to demonstrate literacy in:

* R **AND** Python programming for data analysis
* Critical evaluation of existing data sets and data approaches

To earn the digital badge certifying literacy in these areas, learners must complete the following:

* Attend **all three days** of the Research Data Bootcamp
* Complete a final project (described below) that demonstrates Bootcamp-specific knowledge and skills  

## Final Project

**The final project will be due by August 22, 2021; to submit the project, push your project code to a dedicated GitHub repository, and send us a link to the repository.**

Final projects will consist of a portfolio of work hosted on a GitHub repository (you are also encouraged to publish your portfolio materials via GitHub pages; see below). Completed digital badge project portfolios must include the following elements:

1. **Question or Hypothesis**: A statement of a question or hypothesis that you are interested in investigating with data (the question or hypothesis could be relevant to your formal academic interests, but this is by no means necessary). Briefly explain the variables (which often correspond to the columns of a conventional tabular data set) you would need to answer your question or test your hypothesis.

2. **Python and R Code and Analysis Outputs**: Find a data set that will allow you to explore the question you formulated in (1). Write **two** scripts (one R script should be written using the R language, and the other one should use the Python programming language) that cast light on your question. For example, you might write code that produces a visualization, implements a statistical test, calculates summary statistics, generates a crosstab, or derives a new data set from an existing one (for example, creating a "tidy" data set from an unstructured one).  
* Please note that you are welcome to implement identical analyses in your Python and R scripts (for instance, you could create write code that creates functionally equivalent visualizations in both Python and R) but you are not required to; if you prefer, feel free to implement different procedures in your R and Python scripts.  
* Please comment your code so that other researchers (or your future self!) can easily follow and understand your script.Please remember to cite the data set you use in your analysis in the repository's Readme.  
* Please remember to cite the data set you used for your analysis in the repository's Readme file.  

3. **Data set Evaluation**: A brief (250-500 words) that evaluates a data set with respect to each of the FAIR principles, and best practices for data publishing more generally. In the write-up, you might reflect on the challenges that a user of the data set might encounter, or suggest changes to the data set's documentation or metadata with a view towards enhancing its reusability for future users.

## Submitting Your Work

Please add files that correspond to the above requirements (a statement of a question or hypothesis, R script, Python script, and data set evaluation) to a GitHub repository that is specifically created to host your Digital Badge project materials. When all of your material is uploaded, please send us a link to your repository.

## Examples

To give you a sense of the nature and scope of a possible project, consider the following hypothetical project ideas:

**Example 1:**Using information from a data set that contains information on the geographic locations of US yoga studios, we might calculate the geographic density of yoga studios with respect to a geographic unit of interest. For our portfolio, we might create a table from this data set (ex. “Census Tracts With Highest Yoga Studio Density per Square Kilometer”), which could be accompanied by a visualization that depicts this variation in density (such as a map or bar chart). The table and visualization, along with the code used to generate them, could be pushed up to your GitHub repository as part of your Digital Badge portfolio.


**Example 2:**In a data set of snowfall across several ski resorts/areas, we might write code to generate a table of  summary statistics (i.e. mean, median, standard deviation etc.) for the snowfall variable (and other variables of interest). Alternatively, we could calculate correlations between variables of interest, or formally test hypotheses  using inferential statistics (for example, using a difference of means test or a regression analysis). In this case, the output containing the results of the relevant test(s) (ex. a table of summary statistics, regression table etc.) and the code used to create them would be our portfolio examples.

## Final Project Tips

1. **This does not have to be perfect!** We are looking for demonstrated literacy and understanding of the concepts and discussions through the Bootcamp.

2. **We are here to help!** Please join the end-of-day clinics or reach out to us if you have any questions or are struggling with any aspect of the boot camp or digital badge. Peer support and feedback is an integral part of data work.

3. **Explore relevant online resources!** In addition to reaching out to us for help, we also encourage you to take this opportunity to troubleshoot possible problems by seeking help from online resources and documentation relevant to R and Python. These resources are substantial, and an important part of the learning process involves self-directed troubleshooting using these resources.
